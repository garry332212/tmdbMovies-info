# React + TypeScript + Vite (TSX Movies ) Movies From Real Data Base

Hi Everyone, Welcome to TSXmOVIES : 
This web app is created to display TMDB movies database raw data to users. I created the UI from scratch and just kept applying Tailwind until I found the best designs for each element.
Users can search for their favorite movies or TV shows from the database with easy and quick search functionality. There are three pages, default: Home, Movies, and TV Shows. Each page renders movies based on the endpoints.
Users can click on any movie and a modal window pops up with more detailed info about the selected movie.
